#### you can configure your app-specific password by creating an application in google settings/security/app passwords and then google will generate passowrd for you to use in the nodejs project file

##### then nodemailer will use your Gmail credentials to send mails with subject, text, attachements for multiple recipients. this is a server-side app for the users so they clone the repo and fill their app-specific password, this is not rather be a client-side app because if it is so, anyone with this code will potentially access my credintials which will be security-wise frustrating. Plus, sending email directly from the client-side is unreliable. Emails sent from a client-side JavaScript application may be flagged as spam or blocked by email providers, as they don't typically expect emails to originate from web browsers.
